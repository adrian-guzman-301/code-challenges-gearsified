# 🔫 Gears of War 1 Multiplayer — Combining Player Stat Logs

/*
Write a JavaScript function that takes two arrays of player stat entries as input
and returns a new array containing all entries from both arrays. Use the spread
operator (...) to achieve this.

Example Player Stats to Track:
- killCount
- deathCount
- headshots
- gnasherKills
- explosiveKills
- activeReloadBoost (true/false)
- jammedWeapon (true/false)
- spawnLocation (1-4)
- enemyExecutions
*/

function combineArrays(arr1, arr2) {}

/* Example: Two segments of a match for a player */
const round1Stats = [
  { killCount: 2, deathCount: 0, headshots: 1, gnasherKills: 1, explosiveKills: 0, activeReloadBoost: true, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 1, enemyExecutions: 0 },
  { killCount: 3, deathCount: 1, headshots: 2, gnasherKills: 1, explosiveKills: 1, activeReloadBoost: false, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 2, enemyExecutions: 1 }
];

const round2Stats = [
  { killCount: 1, deathCount: 0, headshots: 0, gnasherKills: 1, explosiveKills: 0, activeReloadBoost: true, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 3, enemyExecutions: 0 },
  { killCount: 2, deathCount: 1, headshots: 1, gnasherKills: 0, explosiveKills: 1, activeReloadBoost: false, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 4, enemyExecutions: 0 }
];

console.log(combineArrays(round1Stats, round2Stats));

/*
Gameplay Mechanic Lens:
- Each object represents a player's stats during a segment of a PvP match.
- Using the spread operator combines separate rounds of stats into a single unified match log.
- Useful for analyzing full match performance, like total kills, deaths, headshots, gnasher kills, or tracking how many rounds had active reload boosts.
