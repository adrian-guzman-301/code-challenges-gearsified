# 🔥 Gears of War Multiplayer — Iterating Over Locust Stats and Loadouts

// Iterating Over the Values of a Locust Character [Object.values]
const locust1 = { name: "Drone", health: 100, dbno: false, powerWeapon: "Boomshot" };

// Example: Check all stats of the Locust
// Object.values(locust1).forEach((value) => console.log(value));

/*
Gameplay Mechanic Lens:
- This is like surveying a Locust teammate's stats before or during a match.
- Object.values lets you quickly see health, DBNO status, and whether they’re carrying a power weapon.
*/

// Iterating Over the Keys of a Locust Character [Object.keys]
const locust2 = { name: "Raam", health: 250, dbno: false, powerWeapon: null };

// Example: Check all the attribute names
// Object.keys(locust2).forEach((key) => console.log(key));

/*
Gameplay Mechanic Lens:
- Think of this as checking which stats or attributes you can interact with: health, DBNO status, power weapon possession.
- Object.keys helps you plan attacks or support your team by understanding available information.
*/

// Iterate over an Array of Weapons in a Locust Loadout [For Of]
const locustLoadout = ["Lancer", "Hammerburst", "Torque Bow"];

/* 
Syntax Example

for (const weapon of locustLoadout) {
  console.log(weapon);
}
*/

/*
Gameplay Mechanic Lens:
- This simulates cycling through weapons held by a Locust player in PvP.
- For Of lets you evaluate which weapon to use next, whether to shoot, reload, or swap to a power weapon.
- Mirrors real-time multiplayer decision-making for Locust units.
