# 🔫 Gears of War 1 Multiplayer — Removing Duplicate Player Stats

/*
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of player stat entries as input
and returns a new array with all duplicate entries removed. Use the Set object
to achieve this.

Example Player Stats to Track:
- killCount
- deathCount
- headshots
- gnasherKills
- explosiveKills
- activeReloadBoost (true/false)
- jammedWeapon (true/false)
- spawnLocation (1-4)
- enemyExecutions
*/

function removeDuplicates(arr) {}

/* Example: Array of kills by a player in a match (with some duplicates) */
const killLog = [
  { killCount: 1, deathCount: 0, headshots: 1, gnasherKills: 0, explosiveKills: 0, activeReloadBoost: true, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 1, enemyExecutions: 0 },
  { killCount: 2, deathCount: 0, headshots: 1, gnasherKills: 1, explosiveKills: 0, activeReloadBoost: false, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 1, enemyExecutions: 0 },
  { killCount: 2, deathCount: 0, headshots: 1, gnasherKills: 1, explosiveKills: 0, activeReloadBoost: false, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 1, enemyExecutions: 0 },
  { killCount: 3, deathCount: 1, headshots: 2, gnasherKills: 1, explosiveKills: 1, activeReloadBoost: true, jammedWeapon: false, spawnLocation: 2, enemyExecutions: 1 },
];

console.log(removeDuplicates(killLog));

/*
Gameplay Mechanic Lens:
- Each object represents a player’s stats for a round or a segment of a match.
- Using Set to remove duplicates is like ignoring repeated identical actions in your match log.
- Stats like headshots, gnasher kills, and explosive kills can have duplicates if multiple rounds are logged, and we want unique entries.
- Useful for creating a clean scoreboard or analyzing unique player performances.
