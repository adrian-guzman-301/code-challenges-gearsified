/*
Write a function that takes an array of weapon names as input and returns a new array
where the first weapon is moved to the end of the array. You must use both `shift` 
and `push` methods to achieve this.

Example:
Input: ["Lancer", "Gnasher", "Boomshot", "Torque Bow"]
Output: ["Gnasher", "Boomshot"]()
