/*
Challenge 1 — Move a Specific Weapon to the End
Write a function that takes an array of weapon names and a weapon as input.
The function should remove the first occurrence of that weapon from the array
and then add it to the end of the array. You must use both `shift` and `push` methods
to achieve this.

Example:
Input: ["Lancer", "Gnasher", "Boomshot", "Torque Bow"], item: "Gnasher"
Output: ["Lancer", "Boomshot", "Torque Bow", "Gnasher"]
*/

/*
Challenge 2 — Remove Duplicate Weapons
Write a function that takes an array of weapon names as input and returns a new array
with all duplicate weapons removed. You must use `reduce` and `push` methods to achieve this.

Example:
Input: ["Lancer", "Gnasher", "Boomshot", "Lancer", "Torque Bow", "Gnasher"]
Output: ["Lancer", "Gnasher", "Boomshot", "Torque Bow"]
