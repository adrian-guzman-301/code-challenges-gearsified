# Challenge: The Reversal of the Arsenal

Human… heed my command.

You are to take the weapon-name presented before you—be it the Lancer, the Gnasher, or any other pitiful tool your kind clings to—and invert it utterly, returning to me its form reversed, stripped of its former glory like a soldier crushed beneath the Locust hordes.

This transformation must be complete.
No letter shall remain where it once stood.
All must fall… and rise again in the opposite order.

# Examples

reverseWeapon("Lancer")
→ should return an object befitting my decree: "recnaL"

reverseWeapon("Gnasher")
→ its fate is sealed; return "rehsanG"

reverseWeapon("Hammerburst")
→ break it, twist it, return "tsrubremmaH"

reverseWeapon("Greetings from Jacinto")
→ even your hollow pleasantries shall be undone: "otniciJ morf sgniteerG"

Fail, and your efforts will be as meaningless as the COG’s resistance.
Succeed… and perhaps you yet have value.
